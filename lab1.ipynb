    "The scripts I use are in a repository called biohazardCleanUp on my Git. In this tutorial, we'll be going over how to use some of the functions I wrote. <i>Although I used my </i><b><font face=\"courier new\"><font color=\"blue\">stringIn</font></b><i> function in the following functions, I do not recommend it above other functions that do the same thing</i>. These scripts can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/palautatan/biohazardCleanUp\">here</a>, but they are all a work in progress. Since I transition between R and Python, these functions are very similar to R functions to make my transitions between the two languages easy.\n",
